If at least 1 quizzer in your team passes the Test for the Round, your team scores 1 point. The team with the highest points at the end of the 7 Rounds wins. Draws are settled with ‘tie-breakers’, which are usually a further Round of Very Hard questions. It is common for Rounds to be themed around certain subjects; if you have a relevant Lore for that subject (as determined by the GM — Lore (History) for a round of questions about the Empire’s past, for example) you may use that Skill in place of your Intelligence for the Round.</span> </p>","img":"modules/wfrp4e-rnhd/assets/images/game.webp","_id":"tsgbgDFQlDSc7sRN"}

It has an army of 48 Dwarf pieces surround a centrally placed army of 12 Elves with an Elven prince in his castle at the centre. Said to be as old as the grudge between the two elder species, Alvataﬂ has the Dwarfs moving very slowly at a single square per go, and the Elves moving swiftly in straight lines. The Dwarfs are trying to kill the prince or capture his castle before he manages to escape the board. Popular in Nordland and Ostland, carved sets of Alvatafl are found in most northern taverns and inns. Larger versions of the game are also common in Kislev — there the game is called </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Zasada </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">and instead depicts 15 centrally-placed Gospodar Winger Lancers with an Ice Witch surrounded by 60 Trolls.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Play</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Each Round, you make a </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence </strong></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">or </span><strong><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Lore (Warfare) </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Test, and add your Intelligence Bonus to the SL. Te total scored by the Elf player shows how many Dwarf pieces are taken that Round. Te total scored by the Dwarf player is quartered, rounding up, to show how many Elf pieces are taken that Round. If you roll a Critical, the game is won automatically if: you are the Dwarf player and the rolled number on the units die is equal or less the number of Elf pieces you have taken; you are the Elf player and the number rolled the units die quadrupled (so a successful roll of 33 would count as 12 as 4 </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color: #545454;\">× </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">3 = 12) is equal or less to the number of Dwarf pieces taken.
